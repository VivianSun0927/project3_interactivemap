# Interactive Mass Shooting Map (Project 3)
## This is an individual repository storing the interactive map data I created for the the [original project](https://github.com/leahkrause/project-3).

## Overview
This map utilizes the Mother Jones - Mass Shootings Database dataset in order to visualize the scale and increasing frequency of mass shootings in modern day US. Clicking on the map markers will pull up details featuring the Case, Location, Date, Fatalities, Injured, and a Summary detailing the events that unfolded during the case. The marker size is scaled based on the number of fatalities, hence the more fatalities per case the larger the markers may appear. Layers have been added divided by decades per case which allows us to make a direct comparison in the number of cases from as far back as 1980s to today.
